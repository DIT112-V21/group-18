What you are going to make?
We are going to make a robot using 2D-mapping system to detect objects and walls etc, for it to later on turn on a UV-light that will sanetize surfaces and objects close to the UV-light. 

A rover type cleaning machine that can map a close space area while providing sanitary service. This smart car prototype can be put in an indoor environment without initial information about the area. However, it will still be able to traverse all empty and passable space to provide the designated cleaning as much as possible.

Why will you make it?
Because the device can be a low priced option for sanitation. Our device can be the upgraded version of the existent romba cleaning machine. For many of us in the group this becomes a new experience where we have the intention to learn from this project.

What problem does it solve?
It solves problems like diseases spreading and other bacteria infecting objects and people in indoor areas, it helps keeping a fresh environment. Faster cleaning time due to definite pathing pattern. Also reducing the chance of being stuck in impassable area.

How you are going to make it?
By using the three different types of sensors attached to both sides and front, we will be able to detect the necessary distance between the smart car and surrounding object. Thus by using a Cartesian 2D map, we will be able to store and recognize area the car has passed through.

What kind of technology you are going to use?
3 different types sensors (Infrared sensor, ultra sonic sensors and micro lidar sensors), The smart car, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains.
